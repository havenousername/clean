Installing Clean
================

Clean uses the linker and assembler from Apple. These are not
installed by default. Therefore first Apple's XCode must be installed.
XCode can be downloaded at:

https://developer.apple.com/xcode/

By default the Clean system is installed in the current directory.
You can override these defaults by changing INSTALL_BIN_DIR,
INSTALL_LIB_DIR, INSTALL_MAN_DIR in the Makefile.

Clean can be used from a shell using a command line interface (clm).

To install the Clean system type:

	% make

Using Clean
===========

To compile Clean programs from a shell you use the command 'clm'. The manual
page for clm provides more information.

Compiling the example programs
==============================

The directory 'examples' contains small Clean programs. The
directory contains a Makefile to compile the examples.
